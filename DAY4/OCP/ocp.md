# ‚úÖ Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ‚Äì Combined Theory + C++ Code

## üìò What is OCP?

> The **O** in **SOLID** stands for the **Open/Closed Principle**.

### **Definition**

> **Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**

This means you should be able to **add new functionality** without **changing existing, tested code**.

---

## üîå Real-Life Analogy ‚Äî Travel Adapter

Imagine you travel from **India to the UK**. Your Indian charger doesn‚Äôt fit UK sockets. Do you:

* ‚ùå Modify the charger? (risky!)
* ‚úÖ Use an adapter?

**The adapter adds functionality without changing the charger.**
This is the essence of OCP: **add via extension, don‚Äôt modify the core**.

---

## üßæ Real-World Use Case ‚Äî Invoicing System (Tax Calculation)

Let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre building an invoicing system that must support **region-based tax rules**:

* India ‚Üí GST: 18%
* US ‚Üí Sales Tax: 8%
* UK ‚Üí VAT: 12%

Over time, new regions (e.g., Germany) will be added.

---

## ‚ùå Bad Design ‚Äî Violates OCP (Hardcoded Logic)

```cpp
class Invoice {
public:
    double calculateTax(const std::string& region, double amount) {
        if (region == "India") return amount * 0.18;
        else if (region == "US") return amount * 0.08;
        else if (region == "UK") return amount * 0.12;
        else return amount; // No tax
    }
};
```

### ‚ùå Problems:

* Each time a new region is added, this method **must be modified**.
* Risk of **breaking existing functionality**.
* Violates **OCP** and **SRP**.
* Not easily **testable** or **scalable**.

---

## ‚úÖ Good Design ‚Äî Follows OCP (Extensible via Polymorphism)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Tax Strategy Interface

```cpp
class TaxCalculator {
public:
    virtual double calculate(double amount) const = 0;
    virtual ~TaxCalculator() = default;
};
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Region-Specific Implementations

```cpp
class IndiaTax : public TaxCalculator {
public:
    double calculate(double amount) const override {
        return amount * 0.18;
    }
};

class USTax : public TaxCalculator {
public:
    double calculate(double amount) const override {
        return amount * 0.08;
    }
};

class UKTax : public TaxCalculator {
public:
    double calculate(double amount) const override {
        return amount * 0.12;
    }
};

// New region ‚Äî added without modifying existing classes
class GermanyTax : public TaxCalculator {
public:
    double calculate(double amount) const override {
        return amount * 0.15;
    }
};
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Invoice Class (Uses Dependency Injection)

```cpp
class Invoice {
private:
    const TaxCalculator& taxCalculator;

public:
    Invoice(const TaxCalculator& calc) : taxCalculator(calc) {}

    double generateInvoice(double amount) const {
        return amount + taxCalculator.calculate(amount);
    }
};
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Main Function (Client Code)

```cpp
int main() {
    IndiaTax indiaTax;
    Invoice invoice(indiaTax);
    std::cout << "Total with tax (India): " << invoice.generateInvoice(1000.0) << "\n";

    GermanyTax germanyTax;
    Invoice invoice2(germanyTax);
    std::cout << "Total with tax (Germany): " << invoice2.generateInvoice(1000.0) << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

---

## üí° How This Follows OCP

* You can **extend** the system by adding a new `TaxCalculator` subclass.
* No changes are needed in the existing `Invoice` or other tax classes.
* Maintains stability, testability, and scalability.

---

## üõ† When to Apply OCP

Apply OCP when:

* A module **is likely to change** (e.g., business rules, regions, formats).
* You need to avoid **touching tested code** when adding new functionality.
* You're building **plugins**, **frameworks**, or **policy-based systems**.
* A class starts becoming a **God Object** (doing too much).

## ‚ùå Common Misconceptions about OCP

| Misconception                               | Reality                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "OCP means code should never change again." | OCP means **core logic shouldn't be touched** unnecessarily.       |
| "OCP creates too many classes."             | Yes, but it's a **trade-off for clean design** and testability.    |
| "OCP makes code hard to read."              | Only in small projects ‚Äî in large systems, it improves clarity.    |
| "OCP should be applied upfront."            | Not always ‚Äî apply when **extension becomes necessary**.           |
| "Refactoring violates OCP."                 | Refactoring is often the **first step to achieve OCP compliance**. |

## üß† Final Interview Notes

* OCP promotes **extensibility without modification**.
* Use **interfaces + polymorphism** to implement.
* Supports **clean architecture** and **plugin-like behavior**.
* **C++ Strategy Pattern** is a common way to apply OCP.
* Best when you observe **repeating conditions** or **switch logic**.
