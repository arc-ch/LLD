# üèÅ Introduction

## üìñ Formal Definition:

A UML Class Diagram provides a high-level overview of the system architecture. It captures the system's classes, interfaces, enumerations, their attributes and operations (methods), and the relationships among them. It is instrumental in both forward and reverse engineering processes and is widely used in modeling object-oriented systems.

Class diagrams support various design activities including domain modeling, data modeling, and architectural representation of systems. These diagrams are often created during the early stages of the software development lifecycle and refined as the project progresses.

Looking at a class diagram, you must quickly be able to understand the system's structure and how different components interact with each other. This is particularly useful for new team members or stakeholders who need to get up to speed with the system's design regardless of understanding the underlying code.

In this section, we will explore the various components of UML Class Diagrams, including classes, attributes, methods, and relationships. We will also discuss the notations used to represent these elements and how they can be effectively utilized in software design.


# üè∑Ô∏è UML Class Notations

### 1. üèõÔ∏è Class Representation

A class in UML is depicted as a rectangle divided into three compartments:

* **Top compartment:** Contains the class name (**bold** and centered).
* **Middle compartment:** Lists the attributes.
* **Bottom compartment:** Lists the operations (methods).

Each attribute or method is listed with its visibility marker, name, and type (for attributes) or return type (for methods). Parameters for methods are also specified in parentheses.

### 2. üîê Visibility Markers

Visibility markers define access levels for attributes and operations:

| Marker | Meaning                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| +      | **Public** (accessible from anywhere)            |
| -      | **Private** (accessible only within class)       |
| #      | **Protected** (accessible in class & subclasses) |
| \~     | **Package** (accessible within the same package) |

These markers help enforce **encapsulation**, a core principle in object-oriented design.

### 3. üìã Attributes and Methods Syntax

* **Attributes:**
  `visibility name: Type [multiplicity] = DefaultValue`

  * **visibility:** Access level (+, -, #, \~)
  * **name:** Attribute name
  * **Type:** Data type (e.g., int, String)
  * **multiplicity:** Optional (e.g., 0..1, 1..\*)
  * **DefaultValue:** Optional default value

Example:
`+ age: int = 21` means public attribute `age` of type int with default 21

* **Methods (Operations):**
  `visibility name(parameterName1: Type1, ...): ReturnType`

  * **visibility:** Access level (+, -, #, \~)
  * **name:** Method name
  * **parameterName:** Parameter name(s)
  * **Type:** Parameter type(s)
  * **ReturnType:** Method return type

Example:
`- isAdult(age:int): boolean` means private method `isAdult` with int parameter `age` returning boolean.

Optional elements like multiplicity, default values, and stereotypes (e.g., `<<constructor>>`, `<<static>>`) can be included to enrich the diagram.

### 4. üõ†Ô∏è Interface

An interface defines a contract that other classes must follow. It contains only abstract methods (no implementation).

UML notation for interfaces:

* Stereotype `<<interface>>` above the name
* Methods listed without implementations

By default, interfaces don‚Äôt include attributes except constants, which may be shown in a separate compartment.

---

### 5. üìê Abstract Class

An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain both implemented and unimplemented (abstract) methods.

UML representation:

* Stereotype `<<abstract>>` above class name
* Class name italicized

üÜö Summary: Abstract Class vs Interface in C++

| Feature              | Abstract Class                | Interface (Simulated via Abstract Class)  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Pure virtual methods | ‚úÖ Must have at least one      | ‚úÖ All methods are pure virtual            |
| Regular methods      | ‚úÖ Allowed                     | ‚ùå Not allowed (in interface-style)        |
| Data members         | ‚úÖ Allowed                     | ‚ùå Not allowed (except constants)          |
| Inheritance          | Single or multiple            | Multiple via base abstract classes        |
| Usage                | Base for real implementations | Define strict contracts for other classes |

### If your abstract class has only pure virtual functions, it's effectively** an interface.** If it has some implemented and some pure virtual, it's a** true abstract base class.**
### Usually we always call it an abstract interface coz mostly we are not providing any implementation in initial class. Only in the concrete(derived) class.

### 6. üìö Enumeration (Enum)

An enumeration is a data type with a fixed set of named values (literals).

UML representation:

* Stereotype `<<enumeration>>` above the name
* List of literals in a compartment below

# üîç Perspectives of Class Diagrams

| **Aggregation** (HAS-A)          | Whole-part where parts can exist independently of the whole                 | Department has Professors; Professors exist even if Department is removed | Hollow diamond at the whole side              |
| **Composition** (Strong HAS-A)   | Strong whole-part; parts cannot exist without whole                         | House has Rooms; destroying House destroys Rooms                          | Filled diamond at the whole side              |
| **Inheritance**                  | IS-A relationship; subclass inherits from superclass                        | Dog is an Animal                                                          | Solid line with filled triangle to parent     |
| **Realization** (Implementation) | Class implements an interface contract                                      | Circle class implements Shape interface                                   | Dashed line with filled triangle to interface |
| **Dependency**                   | Temporary "uses" relationship; changes in used class affect dependent class | OrderService depends on PaymentService                                    | Dashed line with open arrow to used class     |
