# Software Design Principles üíªüßë‚Äçüíª

Software design principles are guidelines that help software developers create systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend. These principles can be applied at both the high-level and low-level design stages.

Here are three cornerstone software design principles:

* **DRY** ‚Äî **Don't Repeat Yourself**
* **KISS** ‚Äî **Keep It Simple, Stupid**
* **YAGNI** ‚Äî **You Aren't Gonna Need It**

---

## 1. DRY ‚Äî Don't Repeat Yourself

This principle states that every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. In simple terms, avoid duplication of logic or code. Repeating code makes the system hard to maintain and error-prone. If a change is required, you might forget to update all occurrences.

### Importance:

* Reduces redundancy
* Easier maintenance
* Single point of change

### ‚ùå Bad Example (C++ Code Violating DRY)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int length1 = 10, width1 = 5;
    int area1 = length1 * width1;
    cout << "Area1: " << area1 << endl;

    int length2 = 8, width2 = 4;
    int area2 = length2 * width2;
    cout << "Area2: " << area2 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In the above code, the logic for calculating the area is repeated in both printArea1() and printArea2() methods. If we need to change the logic, we have to do it in multiple places.


### ‚úÖ Refactored Example (C++ Code Applying DRY)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class AreaCalculator {
public:
    static int calculateArea(int length, int width) {
        return length * width;
    }
};

int main() {
    int area1 = AreaCalculator::calculateArea(10, 5);
    int area2 = AreaCalculator::calculateArea(8, 4);

    cout << "Area1: " << area1 << endl;
    cout << "Area2: " << area2 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In this refactored code, we have created a single method calculateArea that calculates the area. Now, if we need to change the logic, we only need to do it in one place.

### Applying DRY in Practice:

* Identify repetitive code and replace it with a single, reusable code segment.
* Extract common functionality into methods or utility classes.
* Leverage libraries and frameworks when available.
* Refactor duplicate logic regularly across classes or layers.

### When Not to Use the DRY Principle:

* **Premature Abstraction**: Don‚Äôt extract common code too early. Similar-looking code might evolve differently.
* **Performance-Critical Code**: In low-level, high-performance scenarios, duplication might be more efficient.
* **Sacrificing Readability**: If extracted code becomes harder to read, prefer clarity.
* **Legacy Codebases**: Avoid risky refactoring without adequate testing.

## 2. KISS ‚Äî Keep It Simple, Stupid

This principle states that simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. In simple terms, use the simplest possible solution that works. Avoid clever, convoluted code.

### Importance:

* Easier debugging
* Improved readability
* Better maintainability
* Faster development

## Example: 
Assume that we are writing some piece of code to check if a number is even or not. Let's compare a bad (overengineered) vs. a good (simple and readable) example.
### ‚ùå Bad Code (Too Complex)

```cpp
class NumberUtils {
public:
    static bool isEven(int number) {
        // Using unnecessary logic to determine evenness
        bool isEven = false;

        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            isEven = true;
        } else {
            isEven = false;
        }

        return isEven;
    }
};
```
### The above code is considered **BAD** because it:
- Uses extra variables.
- Adds unnecessary if-else logic.
- Makes the code longer and harder to follow.
  
### ‚úÖ Good Code (Simple and Clear)

```cpp
class NumberUtils {
public:
    static bool isEven(int number) {
        return number % 2 == 0;
    }
};
```
### Why the Good Code is Better:

* Simple, one-liner solution
* Easy to read and understand
* Follows the KISS principle by avoiding overengineering

## 3. YAGNI ‚Äî You Aren't Gonna Need It

This principle states:
**"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."**
In simple terms: Don‚Äôt add functionality until it‚Äôs necessary.

Avoid building features that you think you might need in the future. This principle helps to keep the codebase clean and reduces unnecessary complexity.

### Example:

Assume you've been asked to build a note-taking app that allows users to:

* Create a note
* View notes

You start thinking ahead:

> ‚ÄúWhat if later they want categories? Or tagging? Or syncing with Google Drive?‚Äù

This creates a lot of unnecessary complexity and wastes time. YAGNI tells you to build only what‚Äôs needed **right now**.

### Importance:

* Reduced waste
* Simplified codebase
* Faster development

### When NOT to Use YAGNI:

* **When the requirements are well-known**:
  If a feature is guaranteed and soon to be implemented, preparing for it now might be more efficient.
  For example-
  - You're writing a messaging service that currently supports only text, but your product team has committed to image support in 2 sprints.
  - Designing your data model to handle attachments now might save significant refactoring later
* **Performance-Critical Areas**:
   In systems where performance is a first-class concern, avoiding YAGNI might actually help ‚Äî preemptively building and testing real-world usage patterns can catch bottlenecks early.
