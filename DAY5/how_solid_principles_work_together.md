## 🧱 **How SOLID Principles Work Together**

| Principle                                 | 🔍 Core Idea                                 | 🤝 Works Closely With | 🔗 Why It Matters                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **S** - *Single Responsibility Principle* | One class = One job                          | ISP, OCP              | Keeps classes focused and easier to change/test   |
| **O** - *Open/Closed Principle*           | Extend without modifying                     | DIP, LSP              | Enables safe, scalable feature growth             |
| **L** - *Liskov Substitution Principle*   | Subclasses must work as base classes         | OCP, ISP              | Prevents bugs when replacing abstractions         |
| **I** - *Interface Segregation Principle* | Use small, role-specific interfaces          | SRP, LSP              | Reduces unnecessary code and improves flexibility |
| **D** - *Dependency Inversion Principle*  | Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes | OCP, SRP              | Makes code more modular, testable, and swappable  |

## 🔁 How They Support Each Other

### ✅ **OCP + DIP**

* **DIP enables OCP** by letting you inject new behavior via abstractions.
* You can add features (OCP) without editing existing code — just inject a new dependency.

### ✅ **LSP + OCP**

* You can **safely extend** behavior (OCP) if your subclasses **truly behave like their base class** (LSP).

### ✅ **SRP + ISP**

* SRP keeps classes focused, while ISP keeps **interfaces focused**.
* Together: fewer changes, less breakage, better cohesion.

### ✅ **ISP + LSP**

* **Smaller interfaces** (ISP) are easier to implement correctly.
* This leads to better **substitutability** (LSP).

## 🎯 One-Liner Summary for Each

| Principle | One-Liner                                                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SRP**   | Keep each class focused on one responsibility.                                     |
| **OCP**   | You should be able to extend code, not rewrite it.                                 |
| **LSP**   | Child classes should work without surprises.                                       |
| **ISP**   | Clients shouldn’t be forced to implement unused methods.                           |
| **DIP**   | High-level code shouldn’t depend on low-level details — both depend on interfaces. |

## 🧠 Easy Analogy

> **SRP** helps split things into focused parts.
> **OCP** & **DIP** help **plug in new parts** easily.
> **LSP** ensures new parts **behave correctly**.
> **ISP** makes sure each part only **gets what it needs**.
